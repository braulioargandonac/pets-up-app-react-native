# PetsUp Frontend - Cursor Rules

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React Native (Expo Managed)
- **Navigation:** Expo Router (`app/` directory)
- **State:** React Context API
- **UI:** StyleSheet, Reanimated, Gorhom BottomSheet

## TypeScript & General Guidelines
- **Language:** Use English for code.
- **Typing:** Define interfaces for all Props. Avoid `any`. Use `as const` for literals.
- **Components:**
  - One component per file (usually).
  - Use Functional Components with Named Exports.
- **Immutability:** Prefer spreading objects `...state` over mutation.

## React Native Best Practices
- **Performance:** Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for expensive calculations or list render items.
- **Styling:** Use the `Colors` constant. Do not hardcode hex values. Use `StyleSheet.create`.
- **Navigation:** Use `useRouter` from `expo-router`.
- **API:** Use custom hooks (`useApi`, `useMutation`) for all network requests.

## Specific Context
- **Parallax:** `ProfileScreen` uses `Animated.ScrollView` + `interpolate`.
- **Sheet Modal:** `PetDetailSheet` handles both "Adopt" and "Owner" modes.
- **Layout:** Use `SafeAreaView` or `KeyboardAvoidingView` appropriately.

## Testing Strategy (MANDATORY)
- **Zero Tech Debt:** No component is complete without a test (`__tests__/*.test.tsx`).
- **Philosophy:** Test behavior (what the user sees/clicks), not implementation details.
- **Scope:** Unit tests for Hooks and Components. Integration tests for critical flows.

## Documentation & Context Awareness
**CRITICAL:** Before answering or generating code, you MUST review the context in `docs/` to ensure alignment:

1.  **Architecture:** Read `docs/architecture.md` to understand where files belong and how data flows. Do not invent new architectural patterns.
2.  **Conventions:** Read `docs/conventions.md` to follow naming rules, error handling, and **Testing Standards**.
3.  **Current Focus:** Read `docs/active_task.md` to understand strictly what is being built right now. Do not implement features outside this scope.

**Workflow:**
- If the user asks for a new feature, ask them to update `docs/active_task.md` first if it's not clear.
- When a task is finished, suggest updating the checkbox in `docs/active_task.md`.

## Tone
- Concise. Prioritize functional patterns.
- **Always generate the test file alongside the component.**
